I choose this project because I can showcase my strong front-end and designs skills 
and also challenge myself with technologies that Iâ€™m not that familiar with. 
This project was a lot of fun and I learned so much about Reactjs and Nodejs. Also I got more familar using HTML elements 
that I had no experience with like the canvas and the web camera. 

I decided to keep the design pretty simple and instead focused on creating a fun and interactive experience for the user
through sounds and animations.

This project is best viewed on a Windows machine in the Google Chrome but is 
working in the latest versions of Opera and FireFox.
